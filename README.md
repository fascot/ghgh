I made this repository specifically for learning some git commands and testing how my PC works with git bash.

mail.py was a test, in it I just printed random letters.
In mydef.py I wanted to work a little with classes in python and created a class with a couple of games like "Guess the number".
In another class, I made several functions that are used in calculators.
And a function for choosing what will you use. 
mydef.py I checked with pylint. This is an utility that checks the code for PEP8 parameters. PEP8 - beautiful code parameters.
I also made it so that mydef.py could be used as module in other codes and as program.
